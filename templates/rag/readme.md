# RAG

This code template builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for legal regulatory documents. It allows you to upload documents and talk to them with an LLM.

It is extensible and can be updated for really any use-case.

The notebook to use is `rag_template_legal_docs.ipynb` and the regulatory files to use are in `files`.
